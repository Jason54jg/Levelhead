## Technical Information
Due to the nature of the mod, millions of requests are sent to my server every day. As a result, heavy caching rules are in place. All levels are cached for a minimum of 2 days on Cloudflare’s network. The cache time on my website is based on how many requests it is receiving. Less requests will result is shorter cache times. On average, levels are cached for 4 days on my website. When a cache update is called, the player’s level is retrieved from the [Hypixel Public Api](https://api.hypixel.net) and updated across Cloudflare’s network.
